\begin{abstract}
  In this project, we developed and implemented
  a fault-tolerant matrix multiplication algorithm
  capable of handling matrices of arbitrary sizes on a GPU.
  The algorithm incorporates an error detection and correction technique
  to ensure computational accuracy in the presence of errors, and
  different buffering strategies were designed
  to manage memory constraints
  by splitting large matrices into manageable chunks
  that fit within GPU memory.
  We wrote a self-contained benchmark program
  to evaluate the algorithm performance
  when varying settings such as input size, available memory and buffering strategies.
