\section{Overview of the Algorithm}
\label{sec:overview}

Given the matrices $A$ and $B$, our program processes them via to the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep 0em
	\item Choose if and how they need to be split
	\item For each block of the final matrix:
	      \begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
		      \itemsep 0em
		      \item Set $C$ to a matrix of zeros
		      \item For each couple of blocks from $A$ and $B$ that is required to compute the current block of $C$:
		            \begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
			            \itemsep 0em
			            \item Load the block of $A$
			            \item Load the block of $B$
			            \item Add $AB$ to the current $C$
			            \item Add errors to $C$
			            \item Find and correct the errors on $C$
		            \end{itemize}
		      \item Unload $C$ to the RAM
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

All the steps are described more in details in the following paragraphs.
