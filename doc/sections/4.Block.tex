\subsection{Computing the product}

When the matrices are small enough to fit on GPU (or we are working on blocks), the multiplication is realized by means of the standard tiled algorithm for GPU.

Initially, we believed that we could apply one or two recursions of Strassen algorithm to reduce the number of products.
Then, we realized that this would make the same error appear in different submatrices: this would make it much harder to correct it, since non-collinear errors are not correctable.
For this reason, we decided to drop Strassen algorithm at this smaller size level.
