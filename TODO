By priority:

- profile everything
- can further optimize block sizes, memory... ?
- can remove some cudaDeviceSynchronize() ?
- update matmul to various sizes?
- improve timers that are now not so good for split matrices

Paper:

- problem statement
- consideration on which algo to use (we considered strassen but [show calculations of transactions])
- our orchestration of the kernels and buffers
- the safe mm operation (how do we use the checksum, how do we correct/detect errors)
- results (profiling) 

If there is time:

- strassen matrix multiplication

There will be no time:

- use tensor cores (cublas) when available

- split into gpus
