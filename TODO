By priority:

- profile everything
- can further optimize block sizes, memory... ?

Paper:

- problem statement
- consideration on which algo to use (we considered strassen but [show calculations of transactions])
- our orchestration of the kernels and buffers
- the safe mm operation (how do we use the checksum, how do we correct/detect errors)
- results (profiling)
