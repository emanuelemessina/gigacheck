- tiled matrix multiplication
- strassen matrix multiplication
- solve for padding to make strassen work (fake padding with index checking, runtime padding?)
- cutoff condition to switch to classical mm
- configurable depth level for block checksums
- optimize block/ sizes
- split into streams
- split into gpus
